# Individual Front-end Project
This project was undertaken at the end of the front-end portion of my Boolean UK bootcamp. We were given a 5 day period to produce a functional front-end for an idea of our own choosing.

The theoretical end product that I chose to work towards was for a website that could be used for organisation, through a note & list system, with a variety of API sources integrated to extend the functionality beyond that of a basic list system. Hypothetically this would include features such as being able to create a list of films, each of which would automatically have the movie details fetched and attached, with a user then able to select a film from their list and look up showing times in their area.

Given the short time frame for this project I settled on the following primary aims:

 - Self teach how to implement component libraries within React, and use that to produce a single page web app with functional navigation and reactive elements.
 - Implement new styling elements & methods that I have not previously used.
 - Have at least one API source that prompted the user for relevant information, completed an HTTP request and correctly handled the response.

# Tech Stack

 - React
 - React-Router
 - Material-UI

# Personal Feedback

Looking back at my initial aims I do believe I accomoplished what I was aiming for during this project. Using a component library for the first time was an interesting experience, and it allowed me to experiment with elements that I had not used before, including tabs and the masonry layout. By the end of the project I had a functioning single page app with a variety of interactive elements, including giving users a couple of different ways to interact with an API, with the app correctly handling their inputs and the API response.

Given that at this stage it is still very early in my coding journey, a little over 10 weeks after the course began and barely 6 weeks in to learning React, I am pleased with what I achieved in the 5 day timeframe. Experiencing some new tools was very interesting, I gained some good insight in to how to approach a larger project in order to get the most out of myself, and am happy with where I stand as we move on to the next part of the course. There is a lot more to learn but I believe that I am in a good position to continue my learning and build on the foundations I now have.
